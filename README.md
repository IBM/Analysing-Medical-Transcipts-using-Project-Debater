# Analysing-Medical-Transcipts-using-Project-Debater

# Project-Debater


Project Debater is the first AI system that can debate humans on complex topics. Project Debater digests massive texts, constructs a well-structured speech on a given topic, delivers it with clarity and purpose, and rebuts its opponent. Eventually, Project Debater will help people reason by providing compelling, evidence-based arguments and limiting the influence of emotion, bias, or ambiguity.


In this workshop you will get an insight on how to use Project Debater to analyse and derive insights from medical transcipts.
